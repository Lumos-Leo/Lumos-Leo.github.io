I am currently a Ph.D. student at the SICE from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by Prof. Le Zhang and Prof. Ce Zhu. I received my Master's degree at the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT), supervised by Prof. Jianhong Zheng. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree from the Chongqing University (CQU). My research interests include computer vision, and image restoration.
