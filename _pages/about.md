<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Information and Communication Engineering (SICE) at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the joint supervision of Prof. Le Zhang and Prof. Ce Zhu. I earned my Master's degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT), where I was advised by Prof. Jianhong Zheng, and completed my Bachelor's degree at Chongqing University (CQU). My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, with particular interest in image restoration.
